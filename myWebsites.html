<h3>About Me</h3>
<p> Hi! My name is Mykola Tokar. I am a Junior Student at Illinois Institute of Technology where
I am studing Information Technology and Management and I really like it!</p>
<p> I like web development and continuously learn new features about it.
As for me, I think it is unbelievable when simple web page can be addictive as drugs or educative as real teacher.
For example, I think everyone expirienced 2 hours scrolling of instagram with no purpose and from the other side you can read
20 page long article about molecular physics if it is presented with beautiful animation around.
So, I hope some day I will be able to create such cool web content like instagram or New York Times News web page
but now you can check some of my work that I already created. </p>

<h2>Hard coded website</h2>
<p>I created this website on Introduction to Web Development course.
One of my friend asked my to create this website for his company and I used it as my final project.
This is a website for construction company and I tryed to put all necessary information about the company.
The website contains five webpages with different content, so if it is looks interesting for you,
you can follow the link under this discription. </p>
