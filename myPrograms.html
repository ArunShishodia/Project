  <h1>My Programs</h1>
  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p> Hi! My name is Mykola Tokar. I am a Junior Student at Illinois Institute of Technology where
  I am studing Information Technology and Management and I really like it!</p>
  <p> The main thing what I like about programming is solving problems. As for my, programming is something that super hard to begin
  but when you actually started it is becomes really hard to stop. There is always an issue with something and everytime you solving a small problem
  your brain getting a small dose of dopamine which is prety enjoyble. If to speak about what kind of programming am I like or what particular languages
  I would say ".NET Framework and Java programming language are my best friends".
  Right after this introduction you will find couple programs that I personally created .</p>

  <h2>Cafe Program for calculations (.NET C#)</h2>
  <p>I created this website on Introduction to Web Development course.
  One of my friend asked my to create this website for his company and I used it as my final project.
  This is a website for construction company and I tryed to put all necessary information about the company.
  The website contains five webpages with different content, so if it is looks interesting for you,
  you can follow the link under this description. </p>

  <h2>Java Program</h2>
  <p> When I first time heard about wix.com my initial thought was that it is absolutelly useless to create a website on framework like this.
  However, I decided to try build something on it. To my mind, it is pretty good solution for small busnesses when content of the website is simple description of the company.
  So, I spent some time playing with and created a small website for "imaginary" electrical contractor company.
