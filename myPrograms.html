  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p> Hi! My name is Mykola Tokar. I am a Junior Student at Illinois Institute of Technology where
  I am studing Information Technology and Management and I really like it!</p>
  <p> The main thing what I like about programming is solving problems. As for my, programming is something that super hard to begin
  but when you actually started it is becomes really hard to stop. There is always an issue with something and everytime you solving a small problem
  your brain getting a small dose of dopamine which is prety enjoyble. If to speak about what kind of programming am I like or what particular languages
  I would say ".NET Framework and Java programming language are my best friends".
  Right after this introduction you will find couple programs that I personally created .</p>
